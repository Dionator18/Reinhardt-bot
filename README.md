# Reinhardt-bot
My personal Discord bot I made for fun.
This bot requires [discord.io](https://izy521.gitbooks.io/discord-io/content/). Simply follow the instructions on that page, and download discord.io.

(I made this bot for fun so feel free to make whatever changes you like, as long as its not an exact copy)

## About
I made this bot in school. it was originally a bot I made for the Discord group I'm in with my friends. It was also for the purpose
of learning new things in the field of Web Development. One of my friends told me about his bot. Before that I had no idea it was this easy
to create your own bot. He gave me a simple tutorial he made, which was supposed to be for one of his projects for school. He had to present it
in a workshop in our class. But he gave it to me anyway because I really wanted to try it out.

So feel free to check out his bot/tutorial here:

## Warning

Since recent, my bots haven't worked for a while. Apparently this is because the V5 gateway is deprecated.
You can easily solve this by doing the following:

```
npm install discord.io
```
```
npm install woor/discord.io#gateway_v6
```

## Disclaimer

This bot was made for fun. This means there are some curse words in there because it was originally made for me and my friends.
This is by no means a bot made for serious Discord groups. This bot is purely made for entertaining everyone with some inside-jokes.
I just want to clarify this before someone expects this to be some perfect bot everyone needs.

I hope you enjoy my little project I made in school!
